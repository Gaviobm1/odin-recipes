    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Turn overripe, blackened bananas into sweet and fluffy American-style pancakes. Serve with syrup and crunchy, toasted pecan nuts as a delicious brunch treat</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>350g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 very ripe bananas</li>
        <li>2 medium eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>250ml whole milk</li>
        <li>butter, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To serve</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 just ripe bananas, sliced</li>
        <li>maple syrup (optional)</li>
        <li>pecan halves, toasted and roughly chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Sieve the flour, baking powder and a generous pinch of salt into a large bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, mash the very ripe bananas with a fork until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract and milk. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the wet ingredients and swiftly whisk together to create a smooth, silky batter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a little knob of butter in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the pan and cook for several minutes, or until small bubbles start appearing on the surface. Flip the pancake over and cook for 1-2 mins on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stack the pancakes on plates and top with the banana slices, a glug of sticky maple syrup and a handful of pecan nuts, if you like.</p></li>
